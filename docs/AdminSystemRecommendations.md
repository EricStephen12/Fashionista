## Conclusion

The admin system is a critical component for managing the Fashionista platform effectively. It ensures quality control, helps prevent fraud, and provides the tools needed to grow the marketplace in a sustainable way. We recommend starting with core designer verification and monitoring features, then expanding to more advanced analytics and automation capabilities as the platform grows.

A web-based admin panel is the most appropriate solution rather than another mobile app, as administrative tasks typically require larger screens and more complex interfaces than a mobile app can comfortably provide.
