# Fashionista Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core shopping cart functionality for the mobile app MVP
- Centralizing mock data and state management
- Ensuring smooth user experience for product browsing and cart management

## Recent Changes
1. Created centralized mock data service (`mockData.ts`)
   - Defined TypeScript interfaces for data models
   - Implemented mock data for products, designers, users, and orders
   - Added service functions for data operations

2. Implemented cart management system
   - Created CartContext for global cart state management
   - Added persistent storage using AsyncStorage
   - Implemented cart operations (add, update, remove, clear)

3. Updated core shopping screens
   - Enhanced CartScreen with new UI and cart context integration
   - Updated ProductDetailScreen with size/color selection and cart integration
   - Added proper navigation and user feedback

## Active Decisions
1. Architecture
   - Using React Native (Expo) for mobile app
   - Node.js/Express for backend
   - Supabase for database
   - AWS for infrastructure

2. Development
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Redux for state management
   - Styled Components for styling
   - Jest for testing

3. Infrastructure
   - AWS for cloud services
   - GitHub for version control
   - Docker for containerization
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

4. Using AsyncStorage for cart persistence
   - Provides offline capability
   - Maintains cart state across app restarts
   - Simple implementation for MVP phase

5. Cart item identification
   - Using composite keys (productId-size-color) for unique cart items
   - Allows same product in different variants
   - Simplifies cart management

6. UI/UX Patterns
   - Consistent styling across screens
   - Clear feedback for user actions
   - Intuitive product selection flow

## Next Steps
1. Implement CheckoutScreen
   - Add shipping address form
   - Implement payment method selection
   - Create order summary
   - Handle order placement

2. Enhance Product Browsing
   - Add filtering and sorting
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add category navigation

3. Add User Profile Features
   - Order history
   - Saved addresses
   - Payment methods management

4. Immediate Tasks
   - Set up development environments
   - Initialize mobile app with Expo
   - Set up backend server
   - Configure database
   - Implement authentication

5. Short-term Goals
   - Complete user authentication
   - Implement basic store management
   - Set up product catalog
   - Integrate payment system
   - Develop AR measurement system

6. Medium-term Goals
   - Enhance AR/VR features
   - Implement analytics
   - Add social features
   - Optimize performance
   - Strengthen security
